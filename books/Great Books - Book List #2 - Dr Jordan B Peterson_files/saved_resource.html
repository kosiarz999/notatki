True Christianity is meant to influence the world (Matthew 5:13-15, Matthew 13:32-33) and disciple nations (Matthew 28:18-20, Isaiah 2:2-3), not just \"get people saved\" (Matthew 7:21-23, Matthew 23:13-15), and that's why there should be an emphasis on the Kingdom and not just salvation. Even salvation or being born again is a means to an end (John 3:5)... it's a means to get into the kingdom! When you focus on living out the principles of the Kingdom and you actively engage the world and the places of influence you create an environment conducive of the salvation of souls... but that isn't the end in itself... God's purpose for us is to steward what he gives us in this life (Matthew 25:14-29), to be a ruler, a manager, over the purposes and resources he has given each one of us according to our ability and in accordance with his character (Luke 16:1-13).\u003c/p>\u003cp>Religion prepares man to leave earth, the Kingdom empowers man to dominate earth.

Also, you fundamentally misunderstand the bible as a whole, as you forget the original purpose God had for mankind before they sinned... to rule the earth under God's authority. You have too much of an emphasis on salvation as the end goal, and missed the fact that before man sinned God had a purpose for man, and that salvation is a means to reinstate man back to his original assignment. You have to ask yourself the question, what if man never sinned? What was God's original purpose in creating man? Surely it wasn't for man to sin just so God could save them... Rather, after man was given dominion over the earth (Genesis 1:26), they sinned and lost their dominion to the devil (Luke 4:5-7), so Jesus had to come to destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8), take back dominion over the earth (Matthew 28:18), and reinstate humanity back to their original purpose (Matthew 25:34) as ruling as a kingdom of priests (Exodus 19:5-6, Revelation 1:5-6), and Jesus had to give man back the dominion and Kingdom they lost in the beginning (Daniel 7:26).

It's not easy and it requires sacrifice and struggle which is another characteristic of the 'meta hero'. However, once you practice the skill of being attentive and learning the discipline of improving yourself constantly, it will result in the best possible version of you. This will allow you to navigate and hopefully ascend multiple hierarchies.

In his life he didn't accomplish anything good, benefiting for his jewish nation, His llfe was completely irrelevant episode o his nation history and his strategy ended up with him humiiated, hanging on a romano-jewish cross without any supporters. If he would end as a human, nobody, trully nobody would like to copy his ways. But since he died and was not a problem possible to address by Roman Empire and so igored and since his followers created a myth of him being revived (sorry but anybody could survive few hours on cross, as in many cases earlier and later), this IDEA could have rised and lived and spread. All hierarchies are based on competition, and the winning factor i not always strength or cruelty, the wnning factor is effetiveness. Hierarchy doesn't promote being brutal, most people doesn't like it, but also most of them fears it and doesn't oppose it. If leader doesn't deliever effective rule benefiting whoe hiearchy in the first moment of his weakenes he is ejected and a new leader emerges. The same goes with a good leader who is loosing. It's not being good what puts you on top of hierarchy it is being effective in reaching good goals for the whole hierarchy. That's what any real leader is. Being good is not enough, to be effective you need to learn ways of opposing bad guys or you will fail every f-g time. Evil is just a broad idea, not any living force. Evil is in everybody. Good also.

In his life he didn't accomplish anything good, benefiting for his jewish nation, His llfe was completely irrelevant episode o his nation history and his strategy ended up with him humiiated, hanging on a romano-jewish cross without any supporters. If he would end as a human, nobody, trully nobody would like to copy his ways. But since he died and was not a problem possible to address by Roman Empire and so igored and since his followers created a myth of him being revived (sorry but anybody could survive few hours on cross, as in many cases earlier and later), this IDEA could have rised and lived and spread. All hierarchies are based on competition, and the winning factor i not always strength or cruelty, the wnning factor is effetiveness. Hierarchy doesn't promote being brutal, most people doesn't like it, but also most of them fears it and doesn't oppose it. If leader doesn't deliever effective rule benefiting whoe hiearchy in the first moment of his weakenes he is ejected and a new leader emerges. The same goes with a good leader who is loosing. It's not being good what puts you on top of hierarchy it is being effective in reaching good goals for the whole hierarchy. That's what any real leader is. Being good is not enough, to be effective you need to learn ways of opposing bad guys or you will fail every f-g time. Evil is just a broad idea, not any living force. Evil is in everybody. Good also. Same as happyness and sadness or love and hate.","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"5443771647","forum":"jordanbpeterson","depth":2,"points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2017-02-23T01:19:08","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"\u003cp>It's meta because there's a higher value than what is seen.

your lectures consistently for the past few months and I'm starting to understand your views better; however I do have a question.</p><p>I'll probably butcher this summary of what you said, but you say that Jesus is a "meta hero" and have described him as a sort of blueprint for how to conquer an infinite set of dominance hierarchies. My question is how do you come to this conclusion when you read what he said about "the first will be last and the last will be first". He seemed to live his life contrary to dominance hierarchies and seemed to want his followers to abandon seeking their personal gain in all the dominance hierarchies that society creates.</p><p>I hope you see this, and if you do, thank you for your time responding and thank you for all that you've done to promote free speech and encouraging people to seek truth.</p></div></div><span

first it can seem confusing... I think I have a loose understanding that may answer your question... Jesus is the "meta hero" of the "meta dominance hierarchy".. not of a particular dominance hierarchy... so Jesus is playing the "meta game" as opposed to just the game ... and that means he has to play very differently...</p><p>so in any particular hierarchy someone may rule ruthlessly but ultimately because of their ruthless rule they will be displaced as those under them have become disenchanted with how ruthless the ruler is at the top... Jesus on the other hand rules by being the servant (see Luke 22:25-28)... You can think of this approach as a long term approach to ruling at the top of the hierarchy...</p><p>It's even documented that one of the major factors employees look for in the workplace is managers that will put others' needs before their own... this creates better employee loyalty, decreasing employee turnover costs, and possibly increasing productivity and commitment to company objectives... this type of corporate environment can't be created by treating your employees like shit to try to get them to work harder.</p><p>You could also say that you can cheat to win a particular game... but cheating isn't sustainable... the next time you do it you might be caught out and even stripped of your past achievements (think of athletes on steroids). So maybe it's more accurate to think of Jesus' blueprint as something that enables you to sustain your ability to conquer an infinite set of dominance hierarchies.</p><p>You have to remember that although Jesus came as a servant, he is also a king. I think many modern depictions of Jesus have lost touch with his role as a king and that has led to an ill-balanced understanding of the bible. After all, the core message of Jesus was not about getting to heaven after you die or abandoning the hierarchies of society in favor of some magical life after death, rather, his core message was about the influence and impact of the Kingdom of God (a spiritual kingdom) in the world, on earth, in the present. If you read through the gospels you'll see that almost every parable is about the Kingdom of God and it's influence in the world. So the Kingdom of God is like a meta-hierarchy if you will... that is not necessarily opposed to the dominance hierarchies that society creates... rather it has influence over them via the principles and teachings set out by Jesus and throughout the bible.</p><p>That's my understanding of it anyway. If this was helpful in anyway I'd be happy to know. Have a good day.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see

Chan. I do have a small correction to one of the points.<br>Jesus' main goal and entire life mission had everything to do with the afterlife, and the little that had to do with the earthly, present life was itself with the goal of helping others be restored in relationship with God, so that they can be united in the afterlife. According to the bible his Kingship or Kingdom started when he sent the Holy Spirit to give humans access to God through spiritual life (new birth), indwell them (making them ambassadors for the Kingdom), and make Jesus their loved King for the rest of the earthly life (with the goal of increasing his Kingdom) and in the afterlife (fully restored and united with him in his reign).</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer

data-role="message-container" style="height: 374px;"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>I'm not necessarily saying that there is or isn't an afterlife... nor am I saying that the bible doesn't talk about an afterlife... but what I am saying is that Jesus' CORE MESSAGE, in my opinion, is about the Kingdom of God and it's influence on earth according to the GOSPELS.</p><p>I know that this idea is contrary to the mainstream understanding within modern Christianity... but if you read the gospels plainly without going to church and allowing them to teach you some doctrine to view the bible through... you'll see that Jesus' core message was about the Kingdom of God and not even about his death and resurrection (they are just means to an end that fit into the larger context of the kingdom).</p><p>Jesus even says in his own words what his CORE MESSAGE was and he states his mission (why he was sent) in Luke 4:42-43:</p><p>[At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place, and the crowds were looking for Him. They came to Him and tried to keep Him from leaving. But Jesus told them, “I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well, because that is why I was sent.”]</p><p>Then when Jesus sends his disciples out he says in Matthew 10:7:</p><p>[As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.']</p><p>Then when he teaches his disciples to pray he says in Luke 11:1-2:</p><p>[Now it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, that one of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.”</p><p>So He said to them, “When you pray, say:</p><p>Our Father in heaven,<br>Hallowed be Your name.<br>Your kingdom come.<br>Your will be done<br>On earth as it is in heaven.]</p><p>You see it's about God's will being done on earth... not about going to heaven but more about bringing heaven to earth.</p><p>Also Jesus' teaching in the beatitudes demonstrates that principle in Matthew 5:5:</p><p>[Blessed are the meek, For they shall inherit the earth.]</p><p>Jesus also teaches in Matthew 5:13-14:</p><p>[“You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.</p><p>“You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. 16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.]</p><p>Luke 17:21:</p><p>[nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is in your midst."]</p><p>So that's just a sample... but there are many many more examples of Jesus' core message being the Kingdom of God influencing the world.</p><p>I don't wish to argue further but I wanted to show my point of view so others didn't think your view was all that stood. Peace.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer

his life goal not message. His primary message was the Kingdom because he came in order to prepare and send to the world his Kingdom; His purpose in life was to fulfill the mission he was born to fulfill - to become the Messiah, the savior of all who choose him. He had to die for our sin penalty (death) to become the Messiah. Since the penalty for sin was death, physical but especially eternal separation from the God in whom there is no sin, and since God decided to give us grace instead of justice, God himself decided to pay our death sentence, by sending Jesus to die for humanity.<br>The whole point the prophesied Messiah or Christ came and fulfilled over 300 prophecies through his birth, life, death, resurrection, and physical re-appearance, was exactly what that title means.</p><p>It's all about mending the eternal relationship with God, ever since the spiritual death in the garden of Eden.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer

data-role="message-container" style="height: 374px;"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>That is an excellent question Chris. I have thought about this over many years and would like to offer my thoughts around the difference between preparing for heaven and bringing heaven to earth in regards to how each approach impacts our lives from a pragmatic perspective.</p><p>Preparing for heaven isn't very pragmatic at all:</p><p>One of the major criticisms of mainstream Christianity throughout history has been the church's over-emphasis on the afterlife, with a neglect towards the present human condition. Jordan Peterson mentioned in one of his videos that this is why philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche saw Christianity as immoral (roughly speaking). Even in modern mainstream Christianity there is a strong emphasis on the abandonment of this world in favor of going to heaven after you die. They are waiting to either die, or waiting for Jesus to come back to fix their lives. As Austin's reply reveals, the primary focus, from the perspective of the church (not necessarily the bible), is to save souls - which implies the damnation of everything else in this life besides souls. What happens in action is that churches focus solely on "getting people saved" by trying to convert people into believing in their doctrine so that those new converts can do the same thing and can go to heaven when they die. Meanwhile, the actual world is left abandoned, seen as evil, and seen as nothing to do with spirituality or God. This is the Christianity that Austin and Manu_ela_roy subscribe to, powerless in this world, and all powerful in the next. Of course, they'll object to this, but it's clearly exposed in what they have already written. I oppose this kind of Christianity, as I believe it is blinded in one eye, and has strayed from the original intent of the bible.</p><p>The original intent expressed throughout the bible is to bring heaven to earth - a very pragmatic idea:</p><p>God's kingdom rules in the hearts of men (Luke 17:21), as men rule on earth (Genesis 1:26, Psalm 115:16, Matthew 18:18-20), in accordance to God's will and purpose (Matthew 6:10, Proverbs 19:21). True Christianity is meant to influence the world (Matthew 5:13-15, Matthew 13:32-33) and disciple nations (Matthew 28:18-20, Isaiah 2:2-3), not just "get people saved" (Matthew 7:21-23, Matthew 23:13-15), and that's why there should be an emphasis on the Kingdom and not just salvation. Even salvation or being born again is a means to an end (John 3:5)... it's a means to get into the kingdom! When you focus on living out the principles of the Kingdom and you actively engage the world and the places of influence you create an environment conducive of the salvation of souls... but that isn't the end in itself... God's purpose for us is to steward what he gives us in this life (Matthew 25:14-29), to be a ruler, a manager, over the purposes and resources he has given each one of us according to our ability and in accordance with his character (Luke 16:1-13).</p><p>Religion prepares man to leave earth, the Kingdom empowers man to dominate earth. Religion focuses on Heaven, the Kingdom focuses on earth. Religion is reaching up to God, the Kingdom is God coming down to man. Religion wants to escape earth, the Kingdom impacts, influences, and changes the earth. So I'd say there is a big difference to how you live your life and that they are completely different in action and in their impact on the world.</p><p>Also Austin is wrong, we don't follow Jesus' teachings 'because' of the eternal implications of our actions... that would be like only deciding not to cheat on your wife because you feel like you'd go to hell. You don't cheat on your wife because you love your wife! You also obey God, not because of the punishment He may lay upon you, but because you love God. Also, you fundamentally misunderstand the bible as a whole, as you forget the original purpose God had for mankind before they sinned... to rule the earth under God's authority. You have too much of an emphasis on salvation as the end goal, and missed the fact that before man sinned God had a purpose for man, and that salvation is a means to reinstate man back to his original assignment. You have to ask yourself the question, what if man never sinned? What was God's original purpose in creating man? Surely it wasn't for man to sin just so God could save them... Rather, after man was given dominion over the earth (Genesis 1:26), they sinned and lost their dominion to the devil (Luke 4:5-7), so Jesus had to come to destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8), take back dominion over the earth (Matthew 28:18), and reinstate humanity back to their original purpose (Matthew 25:34) as ruling as a kingdom of priests (Exodus 19:5-6, Revelation 1:5-6), and Jesus had to give man back the dominion and Kingdom they lost in the beginning (Daniel 7:26). Most Christian's only know half the story, so they emphasis Heaven, forget earth, and only know about salvation... but have no clue as to what Jesus was even really talking about with the Kingdom of God. Christian's also overlook when the old testament is teaching about the Kingdom of God.</p><p>I've probably got more to say but I think I've shared enough... not trying to be mean... just open and honest... enjoy :-)</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see

class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container" style="height: 374px;"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>No by all means, I love honesty more than anything so I really don't mind. I'm not really Christian, but in a weird way I am. In so far as I have found truth in it, but that these truths can be found in many other places, but that Christianity does a good job in bringing them all together in a easy to remember story (at-least at this point because it's such a huge cultural reference.)</p><p>Because of that, I don't want to get too dogmatic in the interpretation of the Bible, because first I think it's important for the Bible to be interpreting the world correctly.</p><p>I wanted to bring in some outside sources from pre-Christ Greek. <br>"The man who can most truly be accounted as brave is he who best knows the meaning of what is sweet in life and of what is terrible, and then goes out undeterred to meet what is to come." (Pericles' Funeral Oration; 470 - 400 BC) This seems to be saying the same fundamental thing as Christianity in a different way. That a meaningful life is worth fighting for and dying for as a terrible existence is worse than death. In so far as that a soul that is prepared for the Kingdom of Heaven is willing to die for that dream, because it's a worthy dream. Not that it's necessarily attainable or real, but it's much better than an alternative. To an Athenian, Athens was heaven. It was an idea worth dying for. "This, then, is the kind of city for which these men, who could not bear the thought of losing her, nobly fought and nobly died." (Pericles' Funeral Oration; 470 - 400 BC)</p><p>Or as Nietzsche would say 'Those who have a why, can bear any how' or as a patriot would say 'give me liberty, or give me death.'</p><p>Your right. In a pragmatic way, this mindset is required to protect any liberal society worth fighting for. If men aren't willing to die for something, then that something will not exist for long. The Athenians knew this, the American Revolutionaries knew this, and everyone in between knew this.</p><p>I don't think this necessarily requires an imagination of an afterlife, it just takes a bit of mental imagination to understand a mode of being that is worse than death and that to get there all it takes is for people to put life before liberty. It's conceptually easier for people to imagine a higher good or rainbow to chase - with the same result. That's what I mean when I say that they may not be pragmatically different.</p><p>Whether or not an afterlife is true, I think there is a lot of wisdom in Christianity - learned wisdom over many of generations. I don't necessarily believe in heaven and hell literally, but I think in a sense they do both exist on earth and the teachings of Christianity can help you get to this 'heaven' and avoid this 'hell' - which is to say achieving a meaningful life. So yes I do agree that if people become so focused on the afterlife that they forget to live a meaningful life - I think they are seriously mistaken.</p><p>This isn't really a complete thought and I'm more putting forth arguments and agreements than trying to position an ideological position. I think this conversation of religion (and everything else) boils down to a) how to have a meaningful life and b) how to keep it going. There is obviously a lot of conversation about this topic by people much smarter than me, but I do find it to be of utmost importance. It's allusiveness does seem to be a reason to take a 'leap of faith' so to speak - or to say a principled approach to life that put the why before the what; the virtue before the desire.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer

appallingly hateful and nihilistic. So to site him as even a casual argument against any form of, or position within Christianity holds little sway. Christ made plenty of references to eternal life to set it firmly in the center of the intended point. His use of earthly examples in parables are simply a tool to produce good analogies, metaphors, and examples of deeper meaning and higher stakes. Unless Christ rose from the dead and ascended into heaven at the right hand of the Father, we (beleivers) are of all people most to be pitied. So I conclude that without eternal life we haven't much to look forward to today.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more

To take this verse as anything other than face value requires some real mental gymnastics. This was Jesus' purpose for coming to earth.

data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>I never said the afterlife was not something important throughout the bible.... only that Churches have an over emphasis on the afterlife... and missed the message Jesus preached himself, the Kingdom of God. Churches preach about Jesus' life, they don't preach the same message Jesus actually preached - there is a difference.</p><p>Stephen and Paul were willing to die for what they believed so people on earth would gain from that testimony.</p><p>I never said that how to live on earth and eternal salvation are mutually exclusive... but that Christians have adopted an attitude where they abandon the earth only to wait so they can live in heaven. It's Christians that see the two worlds as disconnected - not me.</p><p>Furthermore, everything I said here and in my previous comments do not contradict the scripture "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life." ... I have the feeling you didn't even read what I said in my previous reply, let alone read all the scriptures I painstakingly referenced. If you had, you'd realize that what I am talking about not only includes Jesus' sacrifice for us, but it extends far beyond that.</p><p>I'll state it again: salvation is the means to reinstate man back to his original assignment. So of course Jesus' purpose was to provide redemption, but that's only half the story, the full story is understood by asking, 'what are we being redeemed to do?' We are redeemed so people can continue to fulfill God's law and rule and reign with the authority and power of the Kingdom.</p><p>It's pretty convenient that you skipped over 22+ scriptures that I referenced... and you didn't address any of them... I showed you a scripture that actually shows Jesus himself, in his own words, stating why he was sent, and you didn't bat an eye (Luke 4:42-43: At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place, and the crowds were looking for Him. They came to Him and tried to keep Him from leaving. But Jesus told them, “I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well, because that is why I was sent.”) Instead, you tried to push your agenda on why you thought Jesus was sent. That tells me you are possessed by an ideology and that you are inflexible in assimilating new knowledge.</p><p>You're obsessing over a small part of the puzzle, while I'm holding the box that the puzzle came in with the full picture on the lid - showing you what it's meant to look like. Peace.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer

dir="auto"><div><p>I don't have the time to address all the verses you cited, but what it boils down to is the interpretation of the kingdom of God, whether it's present future or some combination. Historically it's been interpreted different ways since the Bible doesn't really define it. This is a good outline of some of the different interpretations: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblestudytools.com%2Fdictionary%2Fkingdom-of-god%2F%3ArgFVDh8fJ8IQG8UNAzxAumZv2ek&amp;cuid=4737987" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionary/kingdom-of-god/">http://www.biblestudytools....</a> . Many of the verses you cited are talked about here.</p><p>"Christians have adopted an attitude where they abandon the earth only to wait so they can live in heaven. It's Christians that see the two worlds as disconnected". This is a gross mischaracterization of Christians. If they do want to "abandon the earth", that's a problem, but with the exception of a few christian cult leaders giving their followers kool-aid, this is not an accurate characterization. Most sermons you would find from Christian pastors would focus on how to act according to what Jesus preached. And like you said, this doesn't take away from the afterlife emphasis that the Bible has. I still think you're treating these two things as mutually exclusive.</p><p>Christians preach for salvation and to live a holy life just like Jesus preached. You can say there's no emphasis on the second part, but I would completely disagree with you there from my experience in multiple denominations of Christian churches. Transforming our minds, our actions, and our attitude to be more like Jesus is something Paul preached extensively about in his Epistles, and it is not rejected at all by modern Christians like you say.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer

dir="auto"><div><p>I see what you are saying Jared. Jesusx life and missionn accordingto Manu-ela-Roy is correct. Jesus' main job was to restore humanities relationship with God. But I understand your question.</p><p>If you have ever seen the "Star of David" it is the perfect representation of Christs ministry. "The greatest must become least" is the turning upside down of yhe dominance hierarchy. If you read Philippians 2:6-11, it says that Christ- even though he was Godn did not seek equality with God or saw ir as something to be obtained. But He humbled himself and became like one of us, having limitations of human form.</p><p>So, also let us look at the meaning of His life, just to elaborate on the aforementioned point. Salvation and the life of Christ has to deal with the past, the present and the future. In the past, our sins were delt with at the cross but it takes us to accept the invitation, (justification), our eternal afterlife in heaven was delt with there too, (glorification). Now the present is so that we be formed in His ways, (sanctification). So the Christian life is past, present and future. "The God who was, is, and is to come."</p><p>But yes the hierarchy is both. The Most Jigh God became like the least of us and did not assert hierarchical dominance on those he loves. Its like marriage. The mans job is to protect and serve his wife, not rule over her like  brute. That is the difference between the Christian faith and all of the others. Service comes before doninance. But we are to revere God in His examole thriugh Christ. He is the ultimate authority that we are to emulate. By becoming the least and humbling ourselves.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more"

post, as you are quite right in stating that Jesus did not come to preach to his followers that their ultimate goal was going to heaven when they die. The narrative follows the hope of the Kingdom of God, although it is not just a Kingdom in a "spiritual" sense (although a shadow of that is seen in the church) but a literal government that was (is) supposed to be inaugurated when Jesus returns. That is the story when one takes a literal view of what Jesus and his followers taught and hoped in.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a

I haven't read the Bible thoroughly so I'm not sure if Christ represents anything like that, but thought it might be an interesting point of view (and it's how I interpret what embodying the meta hero

lectures is when Prof. Peterson talked about Jesus being a figurehead of transcendence. Rather than identifying yourself as player in a single dominance hierarchy, you have to identify with the process of transformation. This also relates to Nietzsche's 'Overman' which is the concept of constantly improving yourself and your skill set.</p><p>Paying attention to yourself and your environment, you can then make (hopefully) informed decisions about what to focus on in your life. You have to be constantly updating your model of how to act in the world. Taking this approach will help you in multiple situations (i.e. multiple hierarchies; family, work, community etc.). It's not easy and it requires sacrifice and struggle which is another characteristic of the 'meta hero'. However, once you practice the skill of being attentive and learning the discipline of improving yourself constantly, it will result in the best possible version of you. This will allow you to navigate and hopefully ascend multiple hierarchies. </p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden"

pointed out 2600 yrs ago that the one who would truly conquer the world would be the one who didn't care about "conquering" the world (my own translation). He said this as a truth/fact he understood, but many people misunderstood it as a teaching about how to conquer the world.</p><p>Yes Jesus taught that we shouldn't take anything in this life too serious, and being the first itself shall not be the goal, but he was not teaching that we shall be the last either. He meant a real willingness to be the last that can be tested.</p><p>I haven't listened to Prof. Peterson's lecture on this specifically. But I sensed that maybe he sees in Jesus the image of the ultimate true leader who conquered without the desire to "conquer".

dir="auto"><div><p>This is right. All true leaders are servants - that's the exact meaning of the word leader. It doesn't mean someone subdued, of less significance. Nobody who rules others and uses them for only his benefit is a leader. The leader is only a place in the top of any hierarchy. It's a leader accepted and chosen (or not opposed by) by everyone. He is the one who the best fits this position and guarantees outcome benefiting the whole community. At the point when he fails to meet this requirement, this obligation he takes - he cease to be the leader and a search for a new concensus in the community starts, the hierachy reshuffles. Act of ruling others and ordering them can is the part of job of serving community, needed part to accomplish community goals. Lack of leadership can be as catastrophic as a bad leadership, but at least is a part of needed process of searching for a new better leadership. It doesn't mean change of the leader is democratic. It means community accepts any leader who more less meets needs of community and keeps the hierachy stable and the community working effectively, in a way at least acceptable for a big part of community. Even chosing the most aggresive one is a way to meet this goal because his aggresiveness will be directed towards group challanges. It means on the top of the hierarchy you chose will be the person fitting best exactly this hierarchy which members of this group choses - not the hierarchy that is common elsewhere or in a bigger world surrounding. It's actually a new nationless nationalism. No matter what is around if you accept new rules and joing common group you get a vote to choose hierarchy in it - and since this group rules are different then rules of the group which rules everywhere around it attracts all the people marginalised in that bigger system creating underground nation/group/country and a new identity anybody weak can relate with. It is exactly the same as emerging of the Buddism in the strict autoritarian caste-based Hinduist world. 100% the same and based on the same rules granting more universal freedoms that are intolerant against older strict rules. It was Gandi-like concept.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see

Christ was the genius of Christianity. It created a theoretical "dominance hierarchy" in some imaginary afterlife and posited that that was more important than corrupt/bad reality. Furthermore, the opposite of the types that succeeded in reality were to succeed in this theoretical afterlife! This is why Nietzsche called Christianity left-denying and slandering. The long play out of Christianity is what put "slave morality" on the pedestal and left us in the modern age of nihilism.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul

''The first will be last and the last will be first'' if you look at the context which he spoke it in he was talking about how all the prophets and great men, even apostles were sent here to assist you, the teacher is the least of the ones whom are being taught, Jesus said we will do the works he did and even ''greater'' meaning all the great people in the bible were sent here to assist you because you are greater, you will be the ones who cast the crowns. Especially living in the end times which makes more sense. I hope I made sense here.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see

How I understand it, that you win in hierarchies based on cooperation, so if I come up with a strategy to win a game, I should teach to everyone. So to put it as simply as I can, a genuine effort at being good will put you higher in all dominance hierarchies. But being good is tricky as evil lurks in every corner and you have watch it! watch it vigilantly!

dir="auto"><div><p>Machiavelli proved being good is the most failing strategy. Who doesn't learn ways of the most successful sociopatic individuals fails whole community he directs in always loosing competition against other one ruled by such a person without moral brakes. But understand me well. i agree that most brutal and ruthless one won't be the winner of the dominance game. Not because he acts as he acts. But because he is selfish in what he does. Hierarchy, dominance and leadership is not about being good at all also. It is about reaching goals good for and benefiting everybody in the hierachy, reaching good goals at the end, no in the process and what tools you use to do it, is less important because whole hierachy cares about their well being, not about goodness of the world. All good leaders fail and the life of Jesus is a one great failure story. In his life he didn't accomplish anything good, benefiting for his jewish nation, His llfe was completely irrelevant episode o his nation history and his strategy ended up with him humiiated, hanging on a romano-jewish cross without any supporters. If he would end as a human, nobody, trully nobody would like to copy his ways. But since he died and was not a problem possible to address by Roman Empire and so igored and since his followers created a myth of him being revived (sorry but anybody could survive few hours on cross, as in many cases earlier and later), this IDEA could have rised and lived and spread. All hierarchies are based on competition, and the winning factor i not always strength or cruelty, the wnning factor is effetiveness. Hierarchy doesn't promote being brutal, most people doesn't like it, but also most of them fears it and doesn't oppose it. If leader doesn't deliever effective rule benefiting whoe hiearchy in the first moment of his weakenes he is ejected and a new leader emerges. The same goes with a good leader who is loosing. It's not being good what puts you on top of hierarchy it is being effective in reaching good goals for the whole hierarchy. That's what any real leader is. Being good is not enough, to be effective you need to learn ways of opposing bad guys or you will fail every f-g time. Evil is just a broad idea, not any living force. Evil is in everybody. Good also. Same as happyness and sadness or love and hate.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more"

deeper movies but really the depth of the mind looking into the object is what is important. <br>A two year old with a Nietzsche coloring book isn't going to understand the super ego.<br>Daoist saying: If you look deeply into a shallow pool or shallowly into a deep pool you'll see the same thing.</p><p>Crumb is a good movie to see how your childhood can screw you up when your <br>mom wants you to stay her little baby, sexual fetish, paranoia, the 60s,<br> comics, etc</p><p>Altered States is interesting from many points of<br> view: What happens when you look deeply into the subconscious, <br>shamanism, hallucination, attachment to the present, regression etc</p><p>Many animes deal with artificial intelligence: Armitage III and Ghost in the<br> shell are good for this. What happens when you can't tell AI from Human<br> and what are the ethics involved in forcing them to serve and die <br>simply because they aren't a "soft machine."</p><p>Dogma is an excellent movie about its subject.</p><p>Breaking Bad shows a weak, "good" man grow a set of balls, perhaps to much,  <br>when faced with death and the complications that arise around that.</p><p>House shows the intellect vs compassion vs empathy vs wisdom vs many other things.</p><p>The Beatles Anthology documentary shows the birth of pop culture, hero <br>worship, the life cycle of a relationship, the west looks into the east,<br> etc.</p><p>Monty Python shows the different types of humor recombined <br>in unusual ways. They will tell a straight one liner joke, followed by <br>absurdism and then do a bit of physical humor all in ten seconds. This <br>is while they are dressed as women in a prop humor fashion. Who does <br>that with music? Frank Zappa.</p><p>Mr. Robot is schizophrenia in serial tv show form. (During the first season.)</p><p>You can do it in reverse and make a gloss to watch some show in and see if <br>you can spot the different personality types, the dominance hierarchy, <br>who is smart and who is wise. How would different philosophies interpret<br> different actions by different characters and so on.</p><p>Black Mirror has all types of social issues to deal with.</p><p>Great art makes you look at things in a different way. It asks you to do it. <br>Entertainment tells you how to feel and what to think. That is what <br>makes it comfortable. Great minds look and see many different things <br>when investigating just a single object. That is what intelligence is. <br>You are transferring knowledge across different situations. Try actively<br> finding new ways of seeing on your own as an exercise until it becomes <br>part of your everyday patterns.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&amp;f=jordanbpeterson&amp;t_i=1116%20http%3A%2F%2Fjordanbpeterson.com%2F%3Fp%3D1116&amp;t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fjordanbpeterson.com%2Freading-list%2Fgreat-books%2F&amp;t_e=Recommended%20Books%20(Sept%202018%20Edition)&amp;t_d=Great%20Books%20-%20Book%20List%20%232%20-%20Dr%20Jordan%20B%20Peterson&amp;t_t=Recommended%20Books%20(Sept%202018%20Edition)&amp;s_o=default#" class="vote-up  count-1" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">1</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&amp;f=jordanbpeterson&amp;t_i=1116%20http%3A%2F%2Fjordanbpeterson.com%2F%3Fp%3D1116&amp;t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fjordanbpeterson.com%2Freading-list%2Fgreat-books%2F&amp;t_e=Recommended%20Books%20(Sept%202018%20Edition)&amp;t_d=Great%20Books%20-%20Book%20List%20%232%20-%20Dr%20Jordan%20B%20Peterson&amp;t_t=Recommended%20Books%20(Sept%202018%20Edition)&amp;s_o=default#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a href="https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&amp;f=jordanbpeterson&amp;t_i=1116%20http%3A%2F%2Fjordanbpeterson.com%2F%3Fp%3D1116&amp;t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fjordanbpeterson.com%2Freading-list%2Fgreat-books%2F&amp;t_e=Recommended%20Books%20(Sept%202018%20Edition)&amp;t_d=Great%20Books%20-%20Book%20List%20%232%20-%20Dr%20Jordan%20B%20Peterson&amp;t_t=Recommended%20Books%20(Sept%202018%20Edition)&amp;s_o=default#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly=""></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:3316647802"><span class="realtime-replies" style="display: none;"></span><a href="https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&amp;f=jordanbpeterson&amp;t_i=1116%20http%3A%2F%2Fjordanbpeterson.com%2F%3Fp%3D1116&amp;t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fjordanbpeterson.com%2Freading-list%2Fgreat-books%2F&amp;t_e=Recommended%20Books%20(Sept%202018%20Edition)&amp;t_d=Great%20Books%20-%20Book%20List%20%232%20-%20Dr%20Jordan%20B%20Peterson&amp;t_t=Recommended%20Books%20(Sept%202018%20Edition)&amp;s_o=default#" class="realtime-button" style="display: none;"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li></ul></li></ul><div class="load-more" data-role="more" style=""><a href="https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&amp;f=jordanbpeterson&amp;t_i=1116%20http%3A%2F%2Fjordanbpeterson.com%2F%3Fp%3D1116&amp;t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fjordanbpeterson.com%2Freading-list%2Fgreat-books%2F&amp;t_e=Recommended%20Books%20(Sept%202018%20Edition)&amp;t_d=Great%20Books%20-%20Book%20List%20%232%20-%20Dr%20Jordan%20B%20Peterson&amp;t_t=Recommended%20Books%20(Sept%202018%20Edition)&amp;s_o=default#" data-action="more-posts" class="btn load-more__button">Load more comments</a></div></div></section><div id="placement-bottom" data-tracking-area="discovery-south"><div class="post-list" style="height: auto;
