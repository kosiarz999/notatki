<div class=" col-sm-12">

<div><p>You have just completed assessing yourself with 100 phrases. Our systems have compared your-self-ratings to those of 
thousands of other people. You are being compared to men and women of all ages. This means that if you are young, your scores on neuroticism will be higher and on agreeableness and conscientiousness will be lower than if you were compared to people of your own age (with the reverse being true for older individuals). For men, their scores on agreeableness and on neuroticism will be lower than if they were just being compared to men. We decided to make the comparisons simple, so that you know where you stand in comparison to the typical person (with age and sex regarded as irrelevant). </p>

<p>Here are your results: You will see below where you stand in comparison to others in the general population on 
the major traits and their aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Agreeableness: Compassion and Politeness</li>
<li>Conscientiousness: Industriousness and Orderliness</li>
<li>Extraversion: Enthusiasm and Assertiveness</li>
<li>Neuroticism: Withdrawal and Volatility</li>
<li>Openness to Experience: Openness and Intellect</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that each personality trait and aspect (and your relative position with respect to them) 
has advantages and disadvantages. It is for that reason that variation exists in the human population: 
there is a niche for each personality configuration. Much of what constitutes success in life is therefore 
the consequence of finding the place in relationships, work and personal commitment that corresponds to your 
unique personality structure. Good luck with your expanded self-understanding!</p>

<p>Note also that if you find that the descriptions harsher than you might consider appropriate this may mean that you were more self-critical than necessary when completing the questions (remember, the results are based on your own self-report, compared to that of others). This can occur if you were feeling temporarily or chronically unhappy or anxious, or hungry, angry or judgmental when you completed the questions. </p>

<h2>Agreeableness: Typical</h2>

</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-sm-7">

<div><p>You are typical or average in agreeableness, which is the primary dimension of Interpersonal interaction in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Agreeableness has two aspects: compassion and politeness, which will be explained separately. Agreeableness is a very complex trait, with marked positive and negative elements all along its distribution. Because of this, higher scores and lower scores need to be explained at the same time. </p>

<p>People high in agreeableness are nice: compliant, nurturing, kind, naively trusting and conciliatory. However, because of their tendency to avoid conflict, they often dissemble and hide what they think. People low in agreeableness are not so nice: stubborn, dominant, harsh, skeptical, competitive and, in the extreme, even predatory. However, they tend to be straightforward, even blunt, so you know where they stand. </p>

<p>Your score puts you at the 
<strong>57th</strong> 
percentile for 
agreeableness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more 
agreeable than 
<strong>57</strong> 
of them and less 
agreeable than 
<strong>42</strong>
of them.</p>

<div><p>People with typical levels of agreeableness are seen by others as somewhat cooperative, warm and considerate. They look for and even sometimes  see the best in others, and are reasonably interpersonally tolerant (an attitude that is much valued by agreeable people). They are no more sensitive than average to seeing someone’s feelings get hurt and, although sometimes concerned about the emotional state of others, don’t always prefer peace and harmony to conflict. They strike a good balance between submissiveness and dominance. </p>

<p>People with average levels of agreeableness are somewhat forgiving, accepting, flexible, gentle and patient. They sometimes feel pity for those who are excluded, punished or defeated. However, they are less likely than highly agreeable people to be taken advantage of by disagreeable people or those with criminal or predatory intent. They can be skeptical. They believe in cooperation, but also feel that competition, with its losers and winners, has its valid place. They are less likely to lose arguments (and will not typically avoid discussion) with less agreeable people. They can be quite good at bargaining for themselves, and at negotiating for more recognition or power. They are likely to have somewhat higher salaries and earn more money, in consequence. This may mean they are less likely to suffer from resentment or to harbour invisible anger, although this tendency may be increased, if they are high in neuroticism. In addition, because of their tendency to engage in conflict, when necessary, typically agreeable people are less prone to sacrifice medium- to long-term stability and function for the sake of short-term peace. This can mean that problems that should be solved in the present are often solved, and do not accumulate counterproductively across time.</p>
</div>

</div>



</div>
</div>



<div><p>Women are higher in agreeableness than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 61.5. For men it is 38.5. The fact that men are lower in agreeableness than women helps explain their much higher rates of criminal incarceration (90% male). The primary difference between criminals and non-criminals is disagreeableness. If the typical criminal is more disagreeable than 98% of people in the general population, then almost all those criminals will be male. This difference in agreeableness between men and women is largest in countries such as Norway and Sweden, where the most has been done to ensure equality of outcome between the sexes. This provides strong evidence that biological factors rather than environment and learning account for the dissimilarity.</p>

<p>Agreeableness, per se, is not strongly associated with political liberalism or conservatism, but this is because the aspects of agreeableness predict such political belief in opposite ways, and cancel each other out.  Liberals are higher in aspect compassion, and conservatives in aspect politeness. However, alliance with the category of belief that has come to be known as politically correct is strongly predicted by agreeableness (particularly compassion). What this appears to mean is that agreeable people strongly identify with those they deem oppressed, seeing them, essentially, as exploited infants, and demonize those they see as oppressors, seeing them as cruel, heartless predators. </p>

<p>There are large differences between men and women in terms of spontaneous interest, and these also appear associated with agreeableness. Agreeable people, caring as they do for others, are more likely to enter professions associated with people, such as teaching and nursing, which are dominated by women. This is true even in the Scandinavian countries, where attempts to produce gender-equal societies has reached a maximum. Disagreeable people, by contrast, appear to prefer systematizing over empathizing, and are more interested in things – machines and technology. In consequence, professions such as engineering and trades associated with construction and machinery tend to be dominated by relatively disagreeable men. </p>

<p>Agreeableness has two aspects: compassion and politeness.</p>

<h3>Compassion: Low</h3>

</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-sm-7">

<div><p>You are low in compassion, which is one aspect of Agreeableness. Your score puts you at the <strong>21st</strong> percentile for compassion. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less compassionate than <strong>78</strong> of them and more compassionate than <strong>21</strong> of them.</p>

<p>Much less compassionate people are not primarily oriented towards the problems of other people or other living things. They are less swayed by cuteness. They are willing to make other people experience negative emotion by engaging in conflict and competition. They like to win, and will engage in confrontation to do so. They are substantially less concerned about helping other people. They make sure their own needs and interests are attended to, and are less willing to sacrifice for the sake of other people. This can make them harsh and unsympathetic. People might turn to them for the cold, hard truth, but not for a soft, patient, eternally-listening ear. They are less empathetic and caring. However, because they are not primarily other-oriented, they can often negotiate very effectively on their own behalf, and are likely to get at least what they deserve (for their hard work, for example). In consequence, they are unlikely to harbor feelings of resentment or hidden anger. </p>

<h3>Politeness: High</h3>

</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-sm-7">

<div><p>You are high in politeness, which is one aspect of Agreeableness. Your score puts you at the <strong>89th</strong> percentile for politeness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more polite than <strong>89</strong> of them and less polite than <strong>10</strong> of them.</p>

<p>Highly polite people tend to be deferential to authority, and are generally obedient. They are respectful and hate to appear (or to be) pushy. They are uncomfortable challenging other people. Highly polite people will try diligently to avoid conflict, and have a more intense desire than average to steer clear of confrontations or fights. </p>

<h2>Conscientiousness: Moderately Low</h2>

</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-sm-7">

<div><p>You are moderately low in conscientiousness, which is the primary dimension of dutiful achievement in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Conscientiousness is a measure of obligation, attention to detail, hard work, persistence, cleanliness, efficiency and adherence to rules, standards and processes. Conscientious people implement their plans and establish and maintain order.</p>

<p>Your score puts you at the <strong>28th</strong> percentile for conscientiousness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less conscientious than <strong>71</strong> of them and more conscientious than <strong>28</strong> of them.</p>

<p>People moderately low in conscientiousness are not particularly dutiful. They are by no means sloggers. They will only work hard if pushed, and don’t mind wasting time. They are quite likely to procrastinate (particularly if they are also above average in neuroticism). If people with moderately low levels of conscientiousness commit to doing something, there is a good chance they will be late, or delayed, even if there isn’t much reason for it. They tend to find and deliver excuses for their failure under such circumstances. They are not markedly decisive, neat, organized, future-oriented, or reliable, and they find themselves easily distracted. </p>

<div><p>People with moderately low levels of conscientiousness are less likely to obtain higher grades in academic settings (particularly if they are also less intelligent), and generally require substantial supervision to stay on task. For this reason, they make less than optimal managers and administrators. They do not feel compelled to do things by the book, however. This can perhaps be an advantage if they are engaged in creative tasks, where rules must be broken for advancement to take place. They are unlikely to make career accomplishment a primary goal, turning instead to pursuit of safety and security (if high in neuroticism), creative accomplishment (if high in openness), establishment of intimate relationships and friendships (if highly agreeable), or social success, excitement and fun (if extraverted). </p>

<p>People moderately low in conscientiousness tend to be relatively free of guilt, shame, self-disgust and self-contempt. Other people, however, may react negatively to their tendency to slack off (particularly if those other people are disagreeable and conscientious). </p>

<p>Individuals who are moderately low in conscientious are not particularly concerned by failure. They are not judgmental, to themselves or others, and tend towards situational explanations for disappointment, frustration or lack of success. They can handle periods of inactivity and unemployment with relative ease. They tend to downplay the relationship between hard work, diligence and success, believing that chance factors and luck in life play a determining role. They live, in large part, for leisure and very much look forward to time off. They can be good at relaxing, and living in the moment (particularly when low in neuroticism). They are less concerned than average with cleaning, moral purity and achievement. It’s more fun to be at the beach or at a party with a person moderately low in conscientiousness – but you might not want to invite them over on moving day. </p>

<p>People moderately low in conscientiousness are more likely to be political liberals rather than conservatives. This is particularly true if they are also high in openness. </p>

If they are highly intelligent, they are likely to be regarded as underachievers. They don’t focus on work as much as others and are more likely to procrastinate, miss deadlines, or fail to complete assignments or projects completely. They have a tendency to put off responsibilities, concentrating more on fun, worry, relationships, excitement or creative endeavour. They aren’t particularly concerned with schedules, timelines or efficiency, and may have to be supervised excessively before their tasks will be completed. They lack focus and are easily distracted. </p>

This may account for some of the trouble in relation to housework between women and men.

This may happen with sufficient frequency so they end up doing a disproportionate share of such work (even though if they waited a bit longer their less orderly partners, often men, might end up equally troubled and motivated to fix the problem). Orderly people are more likely to have items such as event calendars, drawer organizers, laundry baskets, irons and ironing boards in their immediate environments.</p>

<h2>Extraversion: Low</h2>

<div class="row">
<div class=" col-sm-7">

<div><p>You are low in extraversion, which is the primary dimension of positive emotion in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. You could also think of yourself as high in introversion. Extraversion is a measure of general sensitivity to positive emotions such as hope, joy, anticipation and approach, particularly in social situations. </p>

<p>Your score puts you at the <strong>14th</strong> percentile for extraversion. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less extraverted than <strong>85</strong> of them and more extraverted than <strong>14</strong> of them.</p>

<p>People with low levels of extraversion are much less enthusiastic, talkative, assertive in social situations, or gregarious. They find social contact somewhat draining and tiring, and crave time alone to recharge. They are much less likely to plan parties, tell jokes, make people laugh, or volunteer for community activities. They are more likely to be depressed and to have lower levels of self-esteem (particularly if they are high in neuroticism). They tend to be much less optimistic about the past, present and future. </p>

<div><p>People who are low in extraversion find it easy to keep things to themselves. They are by no means compelled to share everything with everyone. They are not self-disclosing and do not warm up quickly to other people. They are much more comfortable with one-to-one interactions than in a group-oriented situation. They rarely speak up in meetings, and are particularly unlikely to speak first, although they will express an opinion if asked. They are much less likely to captivate and convince, especially in groups, and will rarely be the first to act in an ambiguous situation. </p>

<p>People who are low in extraversion are much better suited to occupations that require work alone or with a few other well-known individuals (such as computer programming or accounting). Jobs involving sales, persuasion, work in groups and public speaking are quite unlikely to appeal to them, and they are less likely to be successful at such things (particularly if they are also high in neuroticism). </p>

<p>People low in extraversion are unlikely to be impulsive, even when offered the opportunity to do something exciting or fun. They are therefore unlikely to sacrifice the future to the present, when something social or group-oriented beckons. They find it relatively easy to be alone to study and work. They are not easily distracted by opportunities to chat, joke and socialize. This is particularly the case if they are also high in conscientiousness. However, when people are introverted and conscientious, they are less productive than when extraverted and conscientiousness, perhaps because they have lower levels of energy. When introverted and comparatively unconscientiousness, however, they are more productive than when extraverted and unconscientious. </p>

<p>People low in extraversion are less dominant in social situations, particularly when they are also low in agreeableness. Less agreeable extraverts tend to be self-centered – something that can be made worse if they are also low in conscientiousness. More introverted people are somewhat protected against such tendencies. </p>

This can be a marked handicap when they are knowledgeable, competent and able, but causes much less trouble when they aren’t. Those very low in assertiveness are very infrequently people of action.

<h2>Neuroticism: Moderately High</h2>

</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-sm-7">

<div><p>You are moderately high in neuroticism, which is the primary dimension of negative emotion in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Neuroticism is a measure of general sensitivity to negative emotions such as pain, sadness, irritable or defensive anger, fear and anxiety. </p>

<p>Your score puts you at the <strong>69th</strong> percentile for neuroticism. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in neuroticism than <strong>69</strong> of them and lower in neuroticism than <strong>30</strong> of them.</p>

<p>People with moderately high levels of neuroticism are somewhat more likely to think that things have gone wrong in the past, are going wrong now, and will continue to go wrong into the future. They are also a bit more likely to be unhappy, anxious and irritable when just thinking or remembering, and when they encounter a genuine problem. They have lower than average levels of self-esteem, particularly when they are also low in extraversion. Neuroticism is a risk factor for anxiety disorders and depression. </p>

<div><p>Moderately high levels of neuroticism may interfere somewhat with both success and satisfaction in relationships and career, with the strongest effect on relationships. Moderately high levels of neuroticism are associated with slightly more concern about mental and physical health, as well as more physician and emergency room visits, and higher than average levels of absenteeism at work and at school (particularly if accompanied by below average levels of conscientiousness). </p>

<p>People with moderately high levels of neuroticism appear to be somewhat risk-averse, which means they will be less likely to pursue or enjoy recreational, career, financial and social situations where the possibility of loss is high. Such people appear to be concerned with maintaining their current status, rather than enhancing it. Perhaps this is a good strategy in genuinely dangerous or uncertain times. </p>

</div>



<div><p>Neuroticism is not a powerful predictor of political belief, either conservative or liberal. </p>

<p>Females tend to be higher in neuroticism than males. The typical woman is higher in neuroticism than 60% of the general population of men and women combined. In part, this may be why women report more unhappiness in their relationships, at work, in school and with their health than men, on average, and why women initiate 70% of all divorces. This difference in neuroticism between men and women appears to emerge at puberty. It is largest in countries such as Norway and Sweden, where the most has been done to ensure equality of outcome between the sexes. This provides strong evidence that biological factors rather than environment and learning account for the dissimilarity. </p>

<p>Trait neuroticism is made up of the aspects withdrawal and volatility. </p>

<h3>Withdrawal: Typical or Average</h3>

<div><p>You are typical or average in withdrawal, which is one aspect of neuroticism. Your score puts you at the <strong>47th</strong> percentile for withdrawal.

<p>Individuals average in withdrawal may occasionally suffer from anticipatory anxiety, but are generally not impeded by it. They can handle new, uncertain, unexpected, threatening or complex situations quite well. They are not more likely to avoid or withdraw in the face of the unknown and unexpected.</p>

<p>People with average levels of withdrawal sometimes feel sad, lonesome, disappointed and grief-stricken, but not too deeply, and not for too long. They experience normal levels of doubt and worry, embarrassment, self-consciousness and discouragement in the face of threat and punishment. They are reasonably but not excessively sensitive to social rejection, and don’t feel hurt too easily. Even when hurt, frightened, or anxious, they can recover in a reasonable amount of time. People with typical levels of withdrawal are not particularly concerned that something bad is going to happen. Technically, withdrawal has been associated with activity in the brain systems that regulate passive avoidance.</p>

They can lash out and are relatively easily annoyed. They are more likely to act out or verbally express their frustration, disappointment and irritability. They can be stirred up and upset and, once angry or irritated, take a longer than average time to calm down. They can be argumentative and lose their composure. They can be provocative in a dispute (particularly if also low in agreeableness).  Perhaps people high in volatility get upset if something bad does happen, while people high in withdrawal (the other aspect of neuroticism) suffer from more concern that something bad might happen.

<p>Your score puts you at the <strong>61st</strong> percentile for openness to experience. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in openness to experience than <strong>61</strong> of them and lower in openness to experience than <strong>38</strong> of them.</p>

<p>People with moderately high levels of openness to experience are somewhat more likely than average to be characterized by others as smart, creative, exploratory, intelligent and visionary. They tend to be more interested in learning and in acquiring new abilities and skills. They are curious and exploratory. They find themselves interested in abstract thinking, philosophy, and the meaning of belief systems and ideologies. They attend cultural events such as movies, concerts, dance recitals, plays, poetry readings, gallery openings and art shows. They are likely to enjoy writing.

<div><p>They are likely to be readers, with a wider range of interests. They have a broader and deeper vocabulary. They can think and learn quite quickly. They are comparatively proficient at formulating new ideas, and tend to be articulate (particularly if average or above in extraversion). People moderately high in openness can sometimes see old things in new ways. They can formulate problems in a diverse range of ways, and can typically generate a reasonable number of problem-solving solutions. They enjoy change, often to make things better, but also just for the sake of change. </p>

<p>People who are moderately high in openness to experience are somewhat less well adapted to situations or occupations that are routinized and predictable. They have some trouble fitting in at the bottom of hierarchies. They are less suited to entry-level, repetitive, rote positions, because they often think up new ways to do things, and such ideas are seldom welcome from someone at the bottom. They are creative thinkers. They tend to shake things up a bit, particularly if they are also disagreeable and assertive, and may be attracted to more revolutionary ideas (particularly if below average in conscientiousness). </p>

<p>Individuals moderately high in openness to experience tend to be entrepreneurial in spirit, as well as smarter and more creative. They have more than average interest in creating new ventures, sometimes for profit, sometimes for curiosity, and sometimes for personal transformation. At least moderately high levels of openness to experience appear necessary to the formation and leadership of business and other forms of complex organization, although conscientiousness appears required for the attention to detail and process management that such organizations also always need. </p>

<p>People moderately high in openness to experience tend to be interested in many things. However, they can still typically settle on a single path in life, to specialize to a necessary degree, and to create an integrated identity (unless they are very high or above in neuroticism and/or very low or below in conscientiousness). People characterized by the combination of moderately high openness to experience and very high or above levels of neuroticism can undermine their own convictions and beliefs by questioning and making themselves lost and anxious. Open, unconscientious people tend to be “under-achievers” (particularly if also above average in neuroticism). Such people appear to have the capability to succeed, can learn quickly, and are creative, but they can have some trouble implementing their ideas. </p>

<h3>Intellect: Moderately Low</h3>

<div><p>Note: Do not confuse the personality aspect of Intellect with IQ. Intellect is a measure of interest in abstract ideas, essentially, while IQ is a measure of processing speed, verbal ability, working memory, and problem solving capacity, and is better measured with a formal IQ test. It is perfectly possible to have a high IQ and a low score on the personality trait of Intellect. </p>

<p>You are moderately low in intellect, which is one aspect of openness to experience. Your score puts you at the <strong>34th</strong> percentile for intellect. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in intellect than <strong>65</strong> of them and higher in intellect than <strong>34</strong> of them.</p>

<p>People moderately low in intellect are less likely to evince interest in ideas and abstract concepts. They tend not to appreciate learning about philosophical ideas. They don’t want to be overloaded with information, particularly if it is complex. They are less intellectually curious, and will rarely voluntarily tackle and solve complex abstract problems. They are less likely to engage in issue-oriented discussions, or to enjoy idea-centered books. They can be somewhat less articulate (particularly if average or lower in extraversion) and may have some difficulty formulating and communicating their ideas. People moderately low in intellect may have a vocabulary of somewhat less than normal breadth and depth, and like to stick with the tried-and-true, rather than learning new ideas and skills. They will be less likely to seek out or generate novel, creative concepts or finding and adapting to new experiences and situations. </p>

<p>The closest synonym for openness (rather than openness to experience, which encompasses openness and intellect) is creativity. Highly open, creative people love beauty. They need an outlet for their creative ability, or they have difficulty thriving. They want to be surrounded by art or beautiful crafts. They are sensitive to color and architectural form. They like to collect things. They are imaginative, and like to daydream and reflect on things. They are affected comparatively deeply by music, often of many genres, and may be musical or artistic themselves (both of these are rare in the general population). They can get thoroughly immersed in a book, or a movie, or in their own thoughts, and become somewhat oblivious to the outside world. They respond strongly to beauty, creativity and art.</p>

<div><p>Highly open, creative people can be impractical and flighty, however (particularly if low in conscientiousness). It can be extremely difficult to transform creativity into money, or into a career. High levels of openness are, furthermore, necessary for entrepreneurial success, and often prove useful at the top of hierarchies, even in very conservative occupations such as banking, accounting and law, which need creative people in leadership positions to provide new vision and direction.</p>

<div><p>Liberals are higher in openness than conservatives (although the biggest difference between the two is openness to experience, at the trait level). </p>

<p>Women are higher in openness than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 56.5. For men it is 44.5.</p>
